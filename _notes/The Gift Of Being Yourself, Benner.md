### Chapter 3

- Knowing ourselves must therefore begin by knowing the self that is known to God. If God does not know us, we do not exist. p45
- The possibility of knowing yourself is grounded in the fact that your self is already known to God. Similarly, the possibility of your knowing God is grounded in the fact that God already knows you. p45
- We are graven on the palms of God's hands and never out of the divine mind. p45



- Even more remarkable, God's love for you has nothing to do with your behaviour. Neither your faithlessness nor your unfaithfulness alters Divine love in the slightest degree. Like the father's love in the parable of the prodigal son, Divine love is absolutely unconditional, unlimited and unimaginably extravagant. p46

- Christians affirm a foundation of identity that is absolutely unique in the marketplace of spiritualities. Whether we realise it or not, our being is grounded in God's love. The generative love of God was our origin. The embracing love of God sustains our existence. The inextinguishable love of God is the only hope for our fulfillment. Love is our identity and our calling, for we are children of Love. Created from love, of love and for love, our existence makes no sense apart from Divine love.
